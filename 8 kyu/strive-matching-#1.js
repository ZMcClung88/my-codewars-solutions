// Strive is a new developer-centric service that is focused on presenting software developers with jobs that excite us. Strive discovers these jobs for developers based on a number of factors.
//
// One of the simplest, yet most important factors is compensation. As developers we know how much money we need to support our lifestyle, so we generally have a rough idea of the minimum salary we would be satisfied with.
//
// Let's give this a try. We'll create a function match which takes a candidate and a job, which will either return a boolean indicating whether the job is a valid match for the candidate.
//
// A candidate will have a minimum salary, so it will look like this:
//
// let candidate = {
//   minSalary: 120000
// }
// A job will have a maximum salary, so it will look like this:
//
// let job = {
//   maxSalary: 140000
// }
// If either the candidate's minimum salary or the job's maximum salary is not present, throw an error.
//
// For a valid match, the candidate's minimum salary must be less than or equal to the job's maximum salary. However, let's also include 10% wiggle room (deducted from the candidate's minimum salary) in case the candidate is a rockstar who enjoys programming on Codewars in their spare time. The company offering the job may be able to work something out.
//
// Of course, compensation is only one filter that will help lead to our satisfaction. What other factors can Strive use to discover jobs that will excite developers?

const match = (candidate, job) => {
  // is this job a valid match for the candidate?
  let n = candidate.minSalary - candidate.minSalary * 0.1;

  if (!candidate.minSalary || !job.maxSalary) {
    throw new Error();
  }

  return n <= job.maxSalary ? true : false;
};
